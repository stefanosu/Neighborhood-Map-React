# NYC Eats / Neighborhood Map (React)

This is my final Front-end Nanodegree Project by Udacity. This project is coded in ReactJS.

## Purpose ##

This app's functionality is to locate my favorite eats in NYC by map. It also includes a search functionality that filters out the markers by query. 

## How to install ##

To install you can either clone by using **git clone** or download a zip file. Afterwards you should use **npm install** to download the dependcies and then to run the app use **npm start** to start.

Please take a look at the [demo site](https://matildevoldsen.github.io/Neighborhood-Map-React-/).

### Google Maps

This application uses The Google maps API render the map and to display the markers.

### Foursquare

In this application I also used Foursquare APT to get information about the locations.
